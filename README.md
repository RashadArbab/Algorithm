### What is this: 

This is a program that takes CSV files with tweets, and then it counts how many times a particular user tweeted. The main point of it is to time different data structures and see which structure can count the fastest


### DataStructures: 

-ArrayLists 

-TreeMaps (RedBlack BST) 

-HashMaps  

### Conclusion: 

-HashMaps take more memory but is the fastest way of storing and looking up data operating on about O(1) time 

-TreeMaps take the mimimum amount of memory and are fast enough for most use cases and run on about O(log(n) time 

-ArrayLists are versatile and are good for storing small amounts of data because they are slow and take O(n^2) time
